Online Detection of Action Start in Untrimmed, Streaming Videos
## Abstract
We aim to tackle a novel task in action detection - Online Detection of Action Start (ODAS) in untrimmed, streaming videos. The goal of ODAS is to detect the start of an action instance, with high cat- egorization accuracy and low detection latency. ODAS is important in many applications such as early alert generation to allow timely secu- rity or emergency response. We propose three novel methods to specifi- cally address the challenges in training ODAS models: (1) hard negative samples generation based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to distinguish ambiguous background, (2) explicitly modeling the tempo- ral consistency between data around action start and data succeeding action start, and (3) adaptive sampling strategy to handle the scarcity of training data. We conduct extensive experiments using THUMOSâ€™14 and ActivityNet. We show that our proposed methods lead to signifi- cant performance gains and improve the state-of-the-art methods. An ablation study confirms the effectiveness of each proposed method.

## We will soon release the source code and trained models.
